# ü™Ñ Quickstart

## What I can do?

With HrFlow-Connectors, you can **synchronize** and **process** multiple **HR data streams** in just a few lines of code.

You can do any kind of data transfer between HrFlow.ai and external destinations :

- Pull jobs : `External Job flow` :arrow_right: ***`HrFlow.ai Board`***
- Pull profiles : `External Profile flow` :arrow_right: ***`HrFlow.ai Source`***
- Push job : ***`HrFlow.ai Board`*** :arrow_right: `External destination`
- Push profile : ***`HrFlow.ai Source`*** :arrow_right: `External destination`

The features offered by this package:

- **Synchronize an entire data** stream with a ready-to-use solution
- **Synchronize only certain data** in a stream meeting a condition defined by you : [`logics`](DOCUMENTATION.md#logics)
- **Format the data as you wish** or use the default formatting that we propose adapted to each connector : [`format`](DOCUMENTATION.md#format)
- **Leverage the provider *HrFlow.ai's ** Job and Profile Warehouse* with a many available options like [`hydrate_with_parsing`](src/hrflow_connectors/connectors/hrflow/warehouse.py#L42) or [`update_content`](src/hrflow_connectors/connectors/hrflow/warehouse.py#L39)
