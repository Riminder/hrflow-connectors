## ðŸª„ Quickstart
### What I can do?
With Hrflow Connector, you can **synchronize** and **process** multiple **HR data streams** in just a few lines of code.

You can do any kind of data transfer between HrFlow.ai and external destinations :
* Pull jobs : `External Job flow` :arrow_right: ***`Hrflow.ai Board`***
* Pull profiles : `External Profile flow` :arrow_right: ***`Hrflow.ai Source`***
* Push job : ***`Hrflow.ai Board`*** :arrow_right: `External destination`
* Push profile : ***`Hrflow.ai Source`*** :arrow_right: `External destination`

The features offered by this package:
* **Synchronize an entire data** stream with a ready-to-use solution
*  **Synchronize only certain data** in a stream meeting a condition defined by you : [`logics`](DOCUMENTATION.md#logics)
* **Format the data as you wish** or use the default formatting that we propose adapted to each connector : [`format`](DOCUMENTATION.md#format)
* **Leverage the provider *Hrflow.ai's ** Job and Profile Warehouse * with a many available options like [`hydrate_with_parsing`](src/hrflow_connectors/connectors/hrflow/warehouse.py#L42) or [`update_content`](src/hrflow_connectors/connectors/hrflow/warehouse.py#L39)

### How to use a connector ?
**Prerequisites**
* [âœ¨ Create a Workspace](https://hrflow.ai/signup/)
* [ðŸ”‘ Get your API Key](https://developers.hrflow.ai/docs/api-authentification)

1. **`pip install hrflow-connectors`**
2. Pick the connector you would like to use. Let's say it's **SmartRecruiters**
3. Navigate to the connector's _README_. That would be [here](src/hrflow_connectors/connectors/smartrecruiters/README.md) for **SmartRecruiters**
4. Choose from the available actions the one you would like to use
5. Navigate to the action's documentation to find ready for copy/paste integration code

:checkered_flag: **TADA! You have just used your first connector.**
