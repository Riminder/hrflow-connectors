  `hrflow-connectors` is an open-source project created by **HrFlow.ai** 
to allow developers to connect easily HR ecosystem component.

This project is designed to simply and easily handle,
complex HR integrations by using [**workflows**](https://developers.hrflow.ai/docs/workflows) feature.
<br/>

## About HrFlow.ai
  https://www.HrFlow.ai is **an API first company that provides the most sophisticated AI-Powered JOB & PROFILE API**. Corporates and Software vendors can leverage our technology layers to Parse, Enrich and Score both job and candidate data. The platform supports +200 apps, pipelines, and code integrations so you can automate workflows with your favorite tools.
  - Our Developers documentation : https://developers.hrflow.ai/
  - Our API list (Parsing, Revealing, Embedding, Searching, Scoring, Reasoning) : https://www.hrflow.ai/api
  - Our cool demos labs : https://labs.hrflow.ai


## ü™Ñ Quickstart
### What I can do?
With Hrflow Connector, you can **synchronize** and **process** multiple **HR data streams** in just a few lines of code.

You can do 3 types of actions:
* `Job flow` :arrow_right: ***`Hrflow.ai Board`***
* `Profile flow` :arrow_right: ***`Hrflow.ai Source`***
* ***`Hrflow.ai`*** :arrow_right: `External destination`

The features offered by this package:
* **Synchronize an entire data** stream with a ready-to-use solution
*  **Synchronize only certain data** in a stream meeting a condition defined by you : [`logics`](DOCUMENTATION.md#logics)
* **Format the data as you wish** or use the default formatting that we propose adapted to each connector : [`format` & `format_function_name`](DOCUMENTATION.md#format)
* **Enrich the data processed with *Hrflow.ai's Parsing*** by activating only one option in the connector : [`hydrate_with_parsing=True`](DOCUMENTATION.md#using-parsing-to-enrich-a-job)

### How to use a connector ?
**Prerequisites**
* [‚ú® Create a Workspace](https://hrflow.ai/signup/)
* [üîë Get your API Key](https://developers.hrflow.ai/docs/api-authentification)

1. **`pip install hrflow-connectors`**
2. **I configure the connector** that I want to use. Let's take for example Crosstalent [`GetAllJobs`](src/hrflow_connectors/connectors/boards/crosstalent).
```python
from hrflow import Hrflow

from hrflow_connectors.core.auth import OAuth2PasswordCredentialsBody
from hrflow_connectors.connectors.boards.crosstalent import GetAllJobs

# 2.1 Hrflow client configuration
client = Hrflow(api_secret="MY_X-API-KEY", api_user="MY_X-USER-EMAIL")

# 2.2 Configuring authentication to Crosstalent via the Salesforce API
access_token_url = "https://test.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token"
auth = OAuth2PasswordCredentialsBody(
    access_token_url=access_token_url,
    client_id="MY_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="MY_CLIENT_SECRET",
    username="MY_USERNAME",
    password="MY_PASSWORD",
)

# 2.3 General connector configuration
action = GetAllJobs(
    auth=auth,
    subdomain="MY_SUBDOMAIN",
    hrflow_client=client,
    board_key="MY_BOARD_KEY",
    hydrate_with_parsing=True,
)
```
3.  I write the line of code `action.execute()` to **run the connector.**

üêá **TADA! You have just called your first connector.**


## üìñ Documentation
To find out **how to use the connectors in detail**, you can take a look at the [üìñ documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md).

## üöÄ Environment
Hrflow connector was initially developed to be integrated into [***workflows***](https://developers.hrflow.ai/docs/workflows).
For this reason **it is compatible with Python 3.6+**.

The project mainly uses 4 packages :
* `requests=="2.26.0"`
* `hrflow=="1.9.0"`
* `pydantic=="1.7.4"`
* `selenium=="3.141.0"`

**To find the list of dependencies, you can look at the [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) file**
