## ü™Ñ Quickstart
### What I can do?
With Hrflow Connector, you can **synchronize** and **process** multiple **HR data streams** in just a few lines of code.

You can do 4 types of actions:
* Pull jobs : `Job flow` :arrow_right: ***`Hrflow.ai Board`***
* Pull profiles : `Profile flow` :arrow_right: ***`Hrflow.ai Source`***
* Push job : ***`Hrflow.ai Board`*** :arrow_right: `External destination`
* Push profile : ***`Hrflow.ai Source`*** :arrow_right: `External destination`

The features offered by this package:
* **Synchronize an entire data** stream with a ready-to-use solution
*  **Synchronize only certain data** in a stream meeting a condition defined by you : [`logics`](DOCUMENTATION.md#logics)
* **Format the data as you wish** or use the default formatting that we propose adapted to each connector : [`format` & `format_function_name`](DOCUMENTATION.md#format)
* **Enrich the data processed with *Hrflow.ai's Parsing*** by activating only one option in the connector : [`hydrate_with_parsing=True`](DOCUMENTATION.md#using-parsing-to-enrich-a-job)

### How to use a connector ?
**Prerequisites**
* [‚ú® Create a Workspace](https://hrflow.ai/signup/)
* [üîë Get your API Key](https://developers.hrflow.ai/docs/api-authentification)

1. **`pip install hrflow-connectors`**
2. **Configure the connector**. Let's take for example Greenhouse [Pull jobs](src/hrflow_connectors/connectors/greenhouse).
```python
from hrflow_connectors import Greenhouse
from hrflow import Hrflow

client = Hrflow(api_secret="MY_X-API-KEY", api_user="MY_X-USER-EMAIL")
Greenhouse.pull_jobs(
    board_token="MY_GREENHOUSE_BOARD_TOKEN",
    hrflow_client=client,
    board_key="MY_HRFLOW_BOARD_KEY"
)
```

üêá **TADA! You have just called your first connector.**


## üìñ Documentation
To find out **how to use the connectors in detail**, you can take a look at the [üìñ documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md).

## üöÄ Environment
Hrflow connector was initially developed to be integrated into [***workflows***](https://developers.hrflow.ai/docs/workflows).
For this reason **it is compatible with Python 3.6+**.

The project mainly uses 4 packages :
* `requests=="2.26.0"`
* `hrflow=="1.9.0"`
* `pydantic=="1.7.4"`

**To find the list of dependencies, you can look at the [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) file**
